# cd-comp-challenge-1
The goal of this project was to recreate the provided image in a webpage, using HTML and CSS. I was allowed to choose my own topic, colors, images and font to fit my own design preferences. I chose my topic as the Wind River Range and supplied my own picture from my travels. I chose my color palette from the colors in my photograph and found a font to match the outdoors theme. I break my webpage up using two media queries, having mobile as the default and then selecting specific parameters to change as the screen enlarges. Below, I have included the image I was tasked to replicate and a screenshot of my own webpage.
